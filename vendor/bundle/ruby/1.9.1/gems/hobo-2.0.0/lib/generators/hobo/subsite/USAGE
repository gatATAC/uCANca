Description:

    Creates a subsite, a namespaced section of your application.

    Controllers for the subsite are created in
    app/controllers/<subsite_name>/ and views are also in their own
    subdirectory.   This allows you to have two different controllers
    and two different sets of views for the same model.

    The subsite will use app/views/taglibs/<subsite_name>_site.dryml
    for common tags. The assets that the subsite will load are
    specified in app/assets/javascripts/<subsite_name>.js and
    app/assets/stylesheets/<subsite_name>.[s]css

    The difference between hobo:admin_site and hobo:subsite is that
    hobo:admin_site limits the subsite to use by administrators only.
