Description:
    The model generator creates stubs for a new model, corresponding
    controller and it's views.

    The generator takes a model name as its argument.  The model name
    may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be
    suffixed with anything.

    As additional parameters, the generator will take attribute pairs
    described by name and type. These attributes will be used to
    prepopulate the migration to create the table for the model and
    give you a set of predefined fixture. You don't have to think up
    all attributes up front, but it's a good idea to add just the
    baseline of what's needed to start really working with the
    resource.

    The generator creates a model class in app/models, a test suite in
    test/unit and test fixtures in test/fixtures/singular_name.yml.
    The generator creates a controller class in app/controllers with
    view templates in app/views/controller_name, a helper class in
    app/helpers, and a functional test suite in test/functional.

Examples:
    rails generate hobo:resource account

        This will create an Account model:
            Model:      app/models/account.rb
            Controller: app/controllers/accounts_controller.rb
            Helper:     app/helpers/accounts_helper.rb
            Views:      app/views/accounts
            Test:       test/unit/account_test.rb
            Test:       test/functions/accounts_controller_test.rb
            Fixtures:   test/fixtures/accounts.yml

    (files generated may vary depending on test suite & fixture configuration)

    rails generate hobo:resource post title:string created_on:date body:text published:boolean

        Creates post model, controller & views with predefined attributes.
