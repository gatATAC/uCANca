<!-- A 'card' is a representation of an sub-object *within* a page, such as a comment on a blog-post, or a single product in a list of produtcs. This definition is just the very basic framework which gives the basis for the automatic cards that get generated. See `app/views/taglibs/auto/rapid/cards.dryml` for the cards that have been generated for your specific application. -->
