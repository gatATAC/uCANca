# This file maps section names to IDs so that the commenting system knows which
# comments belong to which section. Section names may be changed at will but
# IDs always stay the same, allowing one to retain old comments even if you
# rename a section.
#
# This file is autogenerated but is not a cache; you MUST NOT DELETE this
# file and you must check it into your version control system. If you lose
# this file you may lose the ability to identity old comments.
#
# Entries marked with "fuzzy" indicate that the section title has changed
# and that Mizuho has found an ID which appears to be associated with that
# section. You should check whether it is correct, and if not, fix it.
