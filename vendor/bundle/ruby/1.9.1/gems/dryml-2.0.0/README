Fundamental tags that can be considered part of the DRYML core language.

# DRYML

DRYML is the Don't Repeat Yourself Markup Language.  It uses an
XML-like syntax and is best at creating XHTML documents.  It could be
used to create other forms of plain-text documents, but the syntax is
not optimized for that and you may end up with extra carriage returns.
(Which would be a bug, so please send test cases).

DRYML was created for the Hobo project, but this is an extraction from
that project and can be used separately.

# How to use with Rails 3 but without Hobo

- Declare the Dryml gem in your `Gemfile` 
    
    gem 'dryml'

- Then update your bundle

    $ bundle install

- Create an `application.dryml`

    $ mkdir app/views/taglibs
    $ touch app/views/taglibs/application.dryml

Now you can use templates that end in ".dryml" or ".html.dryml".  Controller 
layouts will still be rendered and will enclose your templates, but you can 
disable them if you wish in your ApplicationController:

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      layout nil
    end

# How to use outside of Rails

    Dryml.render("<html><%= this %></html>", {:this => something})

See the [rdoc](http://fixme/doc/Dryml.html#render-instance_method) for
more information.
